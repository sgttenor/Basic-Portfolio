            <p>I've been in music all my life. Found out I had voice when going into     college and really hadn't look back
                I've had to opportunity to travel all over the country and to some other parts of the world singing
                opera, musical theater, and folksongs from my lithuanian heritage. Singing has giving me great joy and I
                have been blessed providing entertainment for a variety of people. Whenever we've gotten standing ovations, I pride myself has
                most have worked long hours and sit trhough a 2 1/2 progam and be entertained. Oh What A Feeling!!!

                I've been interested in coding for some time but never really delved into it until now
                as I have done in this bootcamp. Most of my interest has been in games all my life. Not saying that's
                what I want to focus on but if there's an aspect to that, I might venture forth. As challenging as it is, this is where I should have been a while ago.

                I have a wonderful wife. She's supporting me through this journey. It may be tight financially but I will prevail in this bootcamp. I like solving things and finding solutions. The journey is already exciting. Thank you to the TAs and insctructors that will provide me with the tools for me on this amazing journey.
